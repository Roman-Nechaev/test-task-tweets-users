Test task for Twitter users. Technology stack and libraries used: [ React,
Redux, REST API, Emotion-css, Axios, Notiflix ]. We use "mockapi" as the backend
service.

In this application, you can view user cards and start following them. All
changes are committed to the backend, so don't worry that your changes won't be
saved or displayed incorrectly. You can use the filter to see users you follow,
as well as to see users you're not subscribed to.
